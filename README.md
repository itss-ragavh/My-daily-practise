# Java Practice Repository

Welcome to my Java practice repository!

I am currently a beginner in Java programming and have started uploading my daily practice questions to this repository. My goal is to improve my Java skills by practicing a variety of problems, and I'll continue to upload new questions regularly.

The questions I am practicing include the following types:

### 1. **Array-Based Programs**:
   - Problems involving arrays, including sorting, searching, and manipulating array elements.
   - Example topics: 
     - Sorting an array
     - Finding the maximum/minimum in an array
     - Implementing algorithms like binary search

### 2. **String-Based Programs**:
   - Problems focused on string manipulation and processing.
   - Example topics: 
     - Reversing a string
     - String manipulation (concatenation, substring, etc.)
     - Checking for palindromes and anagrams

### 3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Based Problems**:
   - Problems focused on practicing OOP principles like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - Example topics:
     - Creating classes with methods and attributes
     - Working with constructors and destructors
     - Simple projects using OOP principles

### 4. **Mini-Java Projects**:
   - Small Java projects to practice and apply various concepts in real-world scenarios.
   - Example projects:
     - **Library Book Management System**: A system to manage books in a library, including adding new books, tracking availability, and managing member borrowing.
     - **Bank Account Management System**: A simple system to manage bank accounts, including features like deposit, withdrawal, balance checking, and account creation.
     - Tic-Tae-toe Game
