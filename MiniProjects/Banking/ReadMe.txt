Bank Application

This is a simple console-based banking application written in Java. It allows users to create bank accounts, view account details, deposit and withdraw money, change passwords, and view balance â€” all with password protection for security. The system supports multiple accounts and ensures that only the account holder with the correct password can access or modify account details.

Features:

- Create Account: Users can create a new bank account with an initial balance and set a password.
- View Account Details: Users can view their account details, including the account holder's name and current balance.
- View Balance: Users can check their current balance after verifying their password.
- Deposit Money: Users can deposit money into their account, with checks to ensure positive amounts.
- Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money from their account, with checks to ensure sufficient funds and positive withdrawal amounts.
- Change Password: Users can change their account password after verifying their old password.
- Password Protection: Passwords are required for accessing or modifying account information.
